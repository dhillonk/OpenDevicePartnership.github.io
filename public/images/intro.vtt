00:00.320 --> 00:07.840
Meet the Open Device Partnership, a bold initiative to make building secure, high-quality Windows devices easier and faster than ever.

00:08.720 --> 00:18.640
ODP brings together industry standards and open collaboration to simplify system software across all silicon platforms, x86, ARM, and beyond.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.080
Our goal?

00:20.480 --> 00:27.840
Set new benchmarks in security, performance, battery life, and reliability, while re-using more code and accelerating development.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.200
ODP is already powering real progress.

00:31.520 --> 00:40.400
Projects like our boot firmware, also known as Patina, Secure Embedded Controller firmware, and Unified Windows EC services are leading the way.

00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560
Security isn't optional.

00:43.160 --> 00:49.520
ODP designs software with security-first thinking, modern languages, and secure hardware features built in.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.800
Often device firmware is needlessly fragmented.

00:53.280 --> 00:59.200
By standardizing the plumbing, ODP lets you focus on what really matters differentiation and innovation.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.120
ODP is open-source, partner-driven, and built for speed.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.600
Work together, share code, and build better secure devices, faster.

01:08.280 --> 01:18.560
Whether you're an OEM, ODM, IHV, silicon vendor, or indie dev, ODP is your invitation to shape the future of secure Windows devices.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.800
Explore the docs, clone a repo, or send a pull request.

01:23.120 --> 01:26.080
The Open Device Partnership is ready for your ideas.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.440
Let's build together!
